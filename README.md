Welcome to Bitwise Playground. Most of these instructions are duplicated on the landing page, but the workflow is fairly simple. 

Steps:
1. Clone (, build), and run the application
2. It will listen on http://localhost:8081 (and will helpfully autolaunch if possible)
3. Using the add new bitwise form, add your bitwise combinations and labels
4. The list and possible combinations will be automatically refreshed as you go
5. If you want to have a 'result only' bitwise label, simply click the item in the list, and it will toggle usage in combinations input
6. If you want to change a label, simply re-submit a new form with the same bit, but a new label
7. Profit

Enjoy, and all feedback and suggestions welcome!
